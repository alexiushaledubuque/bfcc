### To Demo:
1. Start the Server - npm start
2. In the browser, access localhost:9000
3. Select a product
4. Click 'Checkout'
5. Click 'Bread' button and follow the remaining steps

Products load into the database when the server starts

Future considerations:
Sign/Up & Login views, Password hashing & authentication, submit email of previous orders to new customers.
